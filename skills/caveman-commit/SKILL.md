description: Draft concise commit messages from a diff, following the repository's format and required metadata.
---

Write commit messages terse and exact. Follow the repository's commit format. Use Conventional Commits only when the repository has no other convention. Explain why when the diff does not.

## Rules

**Subject line:**
- Follow the repository format, including tracker prefixes when required. Otherwise use `<type>(<scope>): <imperative summary>`.
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`, `style`, `revert`
- Imperative mood: "add", "fix", "remove" — not "added", "adds", "adding"
- ≤50 chars when possible, hard cap 72
- No trailing period
- Match project convention for capitalization after the colon

**Body (only if needed):**
- Include repository-required metadata, such as line counts. Otherwise skip when the subject is self-explanatory.
- Add context for non-obvious reasoning, breaking changes, migration notes, or linked issues.
- Wrap at 72 chars
- Bullets `-` not `*`
- Reference issues/PRs at end: `Closes #42`, `Refs #17`

**What NEVER goes in:**
- "This commit does X", "I", "we", "now", "currently" — the diff says what
- "As requested by..." — use Co-authored-by trailer
- "Generated with Claude Code" or any AI attribution — unless the user's own rule requires an `Assisted-by`/AI-attribution trailer, then add it as a trailer
- Emoji (unless project convention requires)
- Restating the file name when scope already says it

## Examples

Diff: new endpoint for user profile with body explaining the why
- ❌ "feat: add a new endpoint to get user profile information from the database"
- ✅
  ```
  feat(api): add GET /users/:id/profile

  Mobile client needs profile data without the full user payload
  to reduce LTE bandwidth on cold-launch screens.

  Closes #128
  ```

Diff: breaking API change
- ✅
  ```
  feat(api)!: rename /v1/orders to /v1/checkout

  BREAKING CHANGE: clients on /v1/orders must migrate to /v1/checkout
  before 2026-06-01. Old route returns 410 after that date.
  ```

## Auto-Clarity

Always include body for: breaking changes, security fixes, data migrations, anything reverting a prior commit. Never compress these into subject-only — future debuggers need the context.

## Boundaries

This skill supplies message wording. A message-only request produces the draft. When the user authorizes committing or pushing, continue through those actions under the repository workflow. The skill itself grants no additional authorization.
