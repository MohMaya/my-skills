## Dependency-Based Parallelization

For operations with partial dependencies, start every promise as early as its inputs allow, chain the dependent ones, and await them together. Each task then starts at the earliest possible moment.

**Incorrect (profile waits for config unnecessarily):**

```typescript
const [user, config] = await Promise.all([
  fetchUser(),
  fetchConfig()
])
const profile = await fetchProfile(user.id)
```

**Correct (config and profile run in parallel):**

```typescript
const userPromise = fetchUser()
const profilePromise = userPromise.then(user => fetchProfile(user.id))

const [user, config, profile] = await Promise.all([
  userPromise,
  fetchConfig(),
  profilePromise
])
```
